        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hi there, I'm Ismail Manjlai, a 24-year-old software engineer currently working as a Software Test Engineer at National Heritage Academies. I have a passion for creating innovative and effective solutions that make people's lives easier.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a software engineer, I specialize in developing web applications using a variety of programming languages and frameworks. I am experienced in front-end development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as back-end development using Node.js and Python. I also have experience with SQL and NoSQL databases, and I'm comfortable working with a variety of frameworks such as React, Angular and some fun ones like Alpine.js
        </p>
        <p>
            In my current role at National Heritage Academies, I work on a team that develops and maintains a suite of web applications used by educators, administrators, and parents across the country. I'm proud to be part of a team that is making a positive impact on education in the United States.
        </p>
        <p>
            When I'm not coding, you can usually find me reading a good book, doodling, or playing video games. I'm also a big fan of travel and have had the opportunity to visit some amazing places around the world.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you'd like to learn more about my experience and skills, please take a look at my portfolio and feel free to reach out to me with any questions.</p>
